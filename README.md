The sources for Effort Engine are here.

They should run with XCode and the newest MacOS version.

You can also download binaries: https://github.com/kolinko/effort/releases/download/0.0.1/effort.0.0.1.zip 

and they should work straight away (you'll need option-click them to get through the gatekeeper).

Upon a first run you will be asked to download the converted weights, and then a matrix multiplication benchmark will run.

Remember that this is a tech demo, it's not a chat, it's far from production ready.

I'll fix the Readme.md tomorrow, just spent the whole day building the website, sorry :)

# Effort Engine

Welcome to the repository for Effort Engine! This project's source code is compatible with XCode and the latest version of macOS.

## Getting Started

### Binaries
You can quickly get started by downloading the precompiled binaries available at:
[Effort Engine v0.0.1](https://github.com/kolinko/effort/releases/download/0.0.1/effort.0.0.1.zip)

To bypass macOS Gatekeeper, hold `option` while clicking to open the downloaded application for the first time.

### Initial Setup
On the first run, you will be prompted to download the converted weights necessary for operation. Subsequently, a matrix multiplication benchmark will execute to demonstrate the capabilities of the engine.

### Source Code

The sources are in Swift & Metal.

Download and open effort.xcodeproj. It should work straight away.
